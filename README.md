# SYS-255-Lab01
During this lab session, we covered the process of configuring pfSense and our Windows virtual machine. Throughout the lab, I encountered some difficulties while trying to follow the provided guide. trying to configuere Ipv4, running the tracert command, and getting wk01 set up was the most challenging for me. this was what i gathered form my research on changing Ipv4:

1.Changing your network configuration to IPv4 involves transitioning or configuring your network to use the Internet Protocol version 4. Here's a summary of the process:

2.Assess Current Configuration: Begin by evaluating your current network setup to determine whether it's using IPv4 or another protocol like IPv6.

3.Access Network Settings: Access the network settings on your device or router. You may need administrative access.

4.Select IPv4: Choose the option to use IPv4 as your network protocol. This is typically done through a drop-down menu or checkbox in your network settings.

5.Configure IPv4 Settings: Depending on your network, you may need to configure specific IPv4 settings, such as the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers. These settings can usually be obtained from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or network administrator.

6.Apply Changes: Once you've configured the IPv4 settings, apply the changes. Your device or router will likely need to restart to implement the new configuration.
